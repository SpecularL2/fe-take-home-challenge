# Connect Four Front-End Engineering Challenge

This challenge provides you an opportunity to demonstrate the following:
* familiarity with React and related tools
* ability to flesh out core logic of a front-end application

This is a starter repository created with `create-react-app` and some extra code and assets. 
In this challenge you will build a connect four game in React from scratch. In connect four
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four), two players take turns placing discs/tiles in
a matrix of seven columns and six rows with the objective of producing a contiguous set of four
tiles, whether vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

Your implementation should allow for two players playing connect four in one browser to play and 
complete a game of connect four. You should implement:

* A way to start a game, where all discs/tiles are cleared from play
* Players to take turns placing tiles, where the turn of the player is clearly visible.
* Recognizing and congratulating the player when a winning state has been achieved.

Bonus:

* A way to traverse game state history

## Getting started

To get the code for the repository:

```
# clone the repo
> git clone git@github.com:SpecularL2/fe-take-home-challenge.git
```

In the project directory, you can run the following command to get a test server started:

```
> npm start
````

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Submission

We request that you avoid posting your solution publicly. Instead, preferablyâ€”upload your submission to a private repo and provide access via [Gitfront](https://gitfront.io/). Follow the website's instructions, or tldr here: (1) click `Get Started -> Create a new account -> Add repository`; (2) copy-paste the repo's SSH link from Github and click `Add`; (3) copy-paste the generated key from Gitfront to the deploy keys in the Github project, and (4) click `Build -> View`, and send us the link. 

This allows you to provide us an easy-to-access shareable link (strongly preferred). Alternatively, if this workflow doesn't work for you just send us the files as a zip attachment (or via some other accessible means).
